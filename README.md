# E-commerce Pet Supply Dashboard (Study-Project)

## Project Overview

This Tableau study project involved creating an executive dashboard to analyze e-commerce data, using a fictitious dataset from Datacamp representing an online pet supply company.

## Data Source

* **Dataset:** Fictitious dataset of an online pet supply company.
* **Source:** Datacamp.
* **Description:** The dataset contains transactional e-commerce information used for learning and analysis purposes.

## Tools Used

* **Tableau:** Used for the final analysis, visualization, and creation of the interactive dashboard. 

## Analysis & Visualizations

The project involved several analytical steps before dashboard creation:
* **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Initial review of the dataset and filtering out invalid data.
* **Metric Creation:** Defining key metrics for sales and expense analysis.
* **Correlation & Market Basket Analysis:** Using techniques like self-joins to create a correlation matrix, market basket analysis to understand product associations.
* **Mapping & LTV:** Implementing state-region mapping and calculating Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).
* **Scenario Analysis:** Building a hypothetical what-if scenario, particularly visible in the shipping cost analysis.


## Key Findings & Insights (Examples from Dashboard)

* The business achieved total sales of approximately $1.55 million with a profit of $427K.
* "Taste of the Wild High Prairie" dog food was a top-selling product.
* Sales performance varied significantly by state.
* Profitability analysis by product and shipping cost simulations were performed.

This dashboard was created as a study project some time ago using a fictitious dataset, primarily for the purpose of learning Tableau and practicing key metrics calculation in e-commerce analysis. While it demonstrates analytical concepts, **reviewing it now highlights areas for improvement in styling, chart design, and layout, showcasing the improvement of my skills since its creation.**
